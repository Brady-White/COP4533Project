Consider the test case below.
n = 7, W = 10
h = [21, 19, 17, 16, 11, 5, 1]
w = [7, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 1]
For a test case like this, the input will be EXACTLY as follows. The first line will contain the values of "n" and "W" separated by a whitespace. The second line will contain the array of "h", with each element separated by a whitespace. Finally, the third line will contain the array of "w", with each element, once again, separated by a white space. This will be the case for all test cases. The sample input is given below.
7 10
21 19 17 16 11 5 1
7 1 2 3 5 8 1

The solution for this test case is below.
Platform1 = [s1...s3];
Platform2 = [s4...s5];
Platform3 = [s6...s7];
cost = 21 + 16 + 5 = 42
To generate the correct output for this test case, the first line should list the number of shelves. The second line should list the cost (height) of the entire bookshelf. Each subsequent line should contain the number of elements in each shelf (i.e. the third line in the output should display "3" because there are 3 paintings placed on the first shelf). This MUST be the case for all outputs. DO NOT print any additional numbers, words, or characters of any kind. The correct output your program should print for this case is listed below.
